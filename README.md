Learning Go with Martini - Blog Series
======================================
This repository contains the code for a series of blog posts that I am
writing as I teach myself Go.  Each blog post's code will be on its own
branch with the master branch having the latest and greatest code for
my sample app. As the posts are plublished there will be a 'read it'.
