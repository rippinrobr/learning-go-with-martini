_I know it has been a while since I've written a post on this series but now that some things are starting to calm down on the family side of things I have started writing the third post in this series. There will still be a little lag inbetween posts but there will be posts!_

Learning Go with Martini - Blog Series
======================================
This repository contains the code for a series of blog posts that I am
writing as I teach myself Go.  Each blog post's code will be on its own
branch with the master branch having the latest and greatest code for
my sample app. As the posts are plublished there will be a 'read it'.

### Working with MongoDB
This post will convert the HTTP GET from the first post into code that reads from MongoDB.  I will also add a POST call that
stores the data in the MongoDb.
